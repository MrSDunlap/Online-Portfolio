That information is then used to find like-minded individuals that could serve as potential friends.</p>

            <div class="persona-description">Since I primarily designed this app for myself, I wanted something that searched deeper into a person’s personality. From the comparative market analysis, the apps chosen did not dive deep enough into the personality aspect, nor did they have an in depth preference system. These were necessities for me. For a 25 year old that is skeptical, does not like to go out much, enjoys practical things, silence, woodworking and operates as an introvert; I very much like the idea of a system taking this information and matching me to others who can resonate. This is my approach.</div>

        <p class="d-description">After a quick search I downloaded the top recommended friend apps to put them against one another. From this analysis, I gathered what was currently being offered, how it was being offered, and its efficacy. This helped guide me through the design process.</p>

        <div class="w-description">For the low-fidelity wireframes. I wanted to go with something simple. The bumble app was very close to perfect so I opted to impliment a few innovations to it. First was to make the personality test more in depth and then add preferences that they did not offer. One of the biggest caveats for me was that there was not many African Americans on the platform. The ability to aim your scope towards specific preferences may fix this issue. User testing will still need to be done. Overall, a more in depth personality test is implimented, preferences have been added, the ability to chat without matching has been added. After participants decide to become friends, they can then exchange images and video chat.</div>
