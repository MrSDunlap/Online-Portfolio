            <img src="./Online Portfolio/imgs/web2_mobile.JPG" alt="" class="persona-image">
            <div class="persona-description">After hours of youtube videos and tutorials I was ready to build an online portfolio to showcase my skill. I picked a cool website and began to replicate it. The layout was clean and I figured it’d be simple to complete. Originally the website was going to be for my photography and architecture.</div>

        <h1 class="d-title">Changing My Mind</h1>
        <p class="d-description">At this point, I realized I thoroughly enjoyed the learning, the design, and the developing processes. I was not having much luck in the architecture area so I figured I’d just change careers. While learning in codecademy, from some software developer friends, and youtube, I picked up HTML and CSS pretty quickly. In this process, I didn’t truly understand the differences between UI, UX, front-end, back-end, full-stack, libraries, or frameworks. I just went with the flow taking in all the information.</p>

    <section class="prototype">
        <div class="p-title">Interactive Wireframe</div>
        <div class="p-description">During the prototyping, it didn’t sit right with me that the design wasn’t my own. At this point I produced a wireframe that I thought would make for a cohesive online portfolio. I thought that a horizontal scroll would be a unique factor that I could add so I designed it to switch main pages on a horizontal scroll and switch to a vertical scroll once a page was officially selected.</div>

    <section class="wireframing">
        <div class="w-title">More Attemps</div>
        <div class="w-description">I took a little break to learn more about my craft and got back to the project. With a better understanding, I was able to design with ease of mind when thinking that I could develop and ideate simultaneously. The design that I landed on was a bit more flamboyant. It made a statement that just didn’t seem like me. So, yet again, I scratched that iteration and started all over. Each time I got better and learned more.</div>

        <div class="hf-title">Current</div>
        <div class="hf-description">Finally I decided to make the website a reflection of myself and values. The color scheme I went with calms me and is reminiscent of the time I had in architecture. The wood accent is testament to the woodworking that I partake in. The transparent menu in mobile view is the last piece to complete my aesthetic of greenery, wooden texture, and glass. With a multifaceted approach similar to architecture, the design and development process almost completed itself. This is the design that I developed for myself.</div>

    <section class="deliverables">
        <h1 class="d-title">Planning</h1>
        <p class="d-description">Throughout this entire process, the one thing I would have done differently is utilize UX design as I do for others, for myself as well. I jumped right to developing most of the time and did little planning. Much time could have been saved had the layout and flow been structured. During this current iteration, having a plan and css variables in place streamlined the entire process and reduced stress that I would’ve experienced had I not done so.</p>

        <div class="f-title">Future Steps</div>
        <p class="f-description">For now, this will do. This project will never simply be done because as I learn more design and development practices, I also learn of all the ways I can express myself and help others express themselves by creating unique experiences.</p>
