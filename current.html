            <p class="hero-description">Currently I am designing a slider/carousel  to showcase my projects a bit better. Thinking of unique ways beyond a slider that is responsive leads my design process. For the about section, I am implementing some javascript to allow for smoother transitions when the button is clicked and the new information is added. I would like the text to fade up and in and the skill bars loaded in.<br> As far as other designs on my portfolio the transition between the landing page and the projects page is too abrupt. For this section I am testing out different color transitions and particles to make the transition more seamless.</p>

        <p class="d-description">Mobile responsiveness currently has a bug that is preventing the javascript from working on mobile devices. This is by far the biggest pain, seeing that it functions properly in developer tools mobile view. If you as a reader have a reasoning behind this, please contact me.</p>
